title: "Does Personality Pick the Poison?"
description: Machine Learning
---

The survey data, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR36536.v1">ICPSR 36536</a>, is maintained by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research from the University of Michigan. The analysis I conducted for my Machine Learning course was motivated by the desire to understand who is at greater risk of using and abusing specific drugs. The analysis identifies clustering of the data and creates models for prediction, specifically whether someone is a user of a drug in the past decade. See more details <a href="https://github.com/figur8s/MLDrugStudy"> here</a>.
